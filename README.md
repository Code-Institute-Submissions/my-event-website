# My Event Website

### at the end of the course I would like to expand this website
### so to create a community of people that will partecipate to my wedding!!

1st assignment - Tech used: Html5, Css3, Bootstrap 3.3.7

Please note: this is a simpler version of my idea  

throughout the course will be implemented with backend resources and Javascript  

Also, has been thought for mobile approach 
with a tablet focus more than desktop due to the offer given to the final user
